					My full name's actually Faye Arabela Santos but that's too long so I never use it.  I'm 14 currently a Grade 9 IB student at Victoria Park CI!
					I'm also an assistant lifeguard which sounds a lot aboutme fun than it actually is. I'm interested in many, many things but mainly, I love Science, Math &amp; <!--places a "&" sign in the text-->Music.
					I'd like to be a doctor in the future, actually and I hope that one day I'll be able to bring good healthcare to places in poverty like where I came from, the Philippines.

					browsing through my <!--links my instagram account--><a class="textLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/dxrk.skye/">Instagram</a>, watching Youtube and just having fun with life! I talk aboutme about myself in detail on the other pages but hopefully I've made a good impression.
					Fingers crossed! In the meantime, check out some of my photos!</p>
