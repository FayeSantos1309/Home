				<div class="sideparagraph"> <p class="heading">Childhood</p> <!--puts a subheading-->
					I was born in Muntinlupa City, Philippines. A small city somewhat near the capital of the Philippines. For a good portion of my toddler years, we lived with my grandparents 
					so that they could help take care of me and my sister, who's a year younger than me, while my parents are running their business.
					But obviously, time came when we had to move out. We got a house at gated subdivision not too far from my grandparents. And with no grandparents around to help anymore, we had a nanny.
					My parents were usually at work and would need help around the house. 
					
					<!--starts a new parapgraph--><p>When I turned 4, I went to a private school and my dad would often drop me off.
					Then he would come pick me up, bring me to our house then the nanny would take it from there. I would still say I had an amazing childhood though!
					My parents would come watch all the little dances my class would do, they'd watch Disney Princess movies with us and etc. I had tons of cousins on both sides of the family too which was always fun and chaotic!</p>

					<div class="sideparagraph"><p class="heading">Moving To Canada</p> <!--puts a subheading-->
						I moved to Canada in May 2017. School in the Philippines end in March. It was almost the end of the Canadian school year 
						so my parents decided that it would just be better if I went to school that September. September comes and I had to go to school which was terrifying.
						I knew English but I definitely didn't know anybody. I mean, I could make friends but the fact that I had no idea what to expect terrified me.
						I quickly meet my friends, whom I talk more about in the <a class="textLink" href="family.html">Friends and Family</a> page. From that point on, life went by pretty good!
						I adjusted quickly to life in Canada, including to the chilling winters which was fairly surprising since it was always 25&deg;C or above in the Philippines.
