					I have many, many hobbies. My parents are the kind of people who make you try everything just to see if you'd like it.
					Turns out, I'm like that too! I would consider myself very adventurous but still someone who enjoys quiet time.
					My hobbies range from zip-lining to reading books which sounds weird 'cause those are two things very far from each other but it's true.
					I love doing lots of things and I'll talk more in detail about some of my hobbies down below.

					<p class="heading">Reading</p>
					<div class="sideparagraph">Ever since I was young, I was always around people who liked reading. 
					My mom, my aunts and some of my cousins love reading and I was always inspired by them. I recall being 8 years old seeing my mom reading
					and thinking, "I wanna look like that". So I got my first book, a children's mystery book, and since then, I've bought so many from romance books, mysteries, sci-fi thrilers, historical fiction and more.
					I have to say, my favorite genre is romantic tragedies though. It's cathartic in a way and I love cathartic entertainment.
					Also, I plan on reading more classic literature since it's so intriguing and I feel like I haven't read anything like it before.
					My goal is to one day own a house with its own small library. I want to have a room full of books from floor-to-ceiling. Hopefully I achieve that dream!

					<p class="heading">Writing</p>
					<div class="sideparagraph">Writing is a fairly new hobby of mine. I think I only started 1 year ago actually.
					Nonetheless, writing has helped me so much and I absolutely enjoy doing it. It gives me a space to let out all my feelings and to let my creativity flow!
					I started with only writing short stories, averaging 500 words each but as I got more experience, they became longer and the plots more complex.
					Now, I write books with an average of 5k words which is actually fairly short, unlike how it sounds. They normally reflect how I feel during the time.
					I would usually project my personal feelings to the main character of short stories. It's sort of become a way of venting for me.

					<p class="heading">PLAYING THE FLUTE</p>
					<div class="sideparagraph">
					I remember in 6th grade, coming into music class, knowing in my head exactly what instrument I wanted to play. 
					I didn't know the first thing about a flute though. My family were always musically-inclined but never in instruments.
					However, my music teacher then, Mr.Karpenko, happily offered me extra support and countless booklets on how to play it properly, aside from the class time we had twice a week.
					When all my other classmates were switching instruments at the start of 7th grade, I stayed with my flute and practiced harder. I eventually joined my middle school wind ensemble in 8th grade
					and I had so much fun there. I actually have music on my next school quadmester so I'm very excited to be able to play my flute again!

					<p class="heading">Browsing the Internet</p>
					<div class="sideparagraph">I'm not quite sure if this is actually considered a hobby but I do do it. I'm not even going to lie, I do it a lot actually.
					I think I spend at least 4 hours a day on my phone browsing Instagram and Twitter for funny or relatable memes/tweets. 
					I look through my Youtube recommended page too to watch all the celebrity interviews and whatnot. I love trying to find behind-the-scenes videos of my favorite shows.
					Speaking of Twitter though, on the right side there, I put one of my current favorite tweets. People on Twitter are just funny and relatable, you know?
					But aside from all the goofy stuff, I use social media and the internet to keep up with world news like the US elections, the Black Lives Matter movement and obviously, COVID news.
					I think social media can be a great platform for that and when I'm not looking at memes, funny videos, etc, I spend my time reading articles and educating myself on the world.
					Although, personally, I use social media as a fun, easy distraction to the world even just for a little bit.
